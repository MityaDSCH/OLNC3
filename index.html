                    <p>As a Registered Nurse for 28 years, I have had the opportunity to gain experience in a variety of specialties in many settings. This has enabled me to acquire the expertise needed as a Legal Nurse Consultant. Being clinically active on a pediatric/oncology unit, as well as a specialty infusion nurse, allows me to stay current with my skills and knowledge. In my previous nursing role as an educator/supervisor in a triage call center and as a Nurse Liaison for an LTACH, I learned the value of excellent communication, both verbal and written. I also have maternal child health experience working in an OB/Postpartum unit, level 2 nursery, childbirth, lactation & childhood development education, and birth curriculum development. <br></br> All of these experiences have provided me with extensive knowledge of the healthcare system, enabling me to assist clients in navigating through these systems to achieve a successful outcome to your case.
